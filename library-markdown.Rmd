This webpage is a very basic analysis of BCC libraries and their data. Included is an interactice map showing all BCC libraries, a simple graph showing some of the types of books borrowed at each library, and an interactive table that highlights the top borrowed from libraries each month. To filter through these features, simply select any of them from the tab below.
